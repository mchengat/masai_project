    "# Traffic Congestion Incident Detection Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Traffic congestion and unexpected incidents pose significant challenges to urban transportation systems. This project presents a machine learning–based approach to detect traffic congestion and road incidents using features derived from aerial camera feeds such as vehicle speed, density, lane occupancy, and queue length. Multiple classification models were evaluated with a primary focus on maximizing recall to avoid missed incidents while maintaining a balanced F1-score. The final model demonstrates stable performance and practical suitability for real-time traffic monitoring systems."

    "2. avg_vehicle_speed: The mean speed of all vehicles. Lower speeds directly correlate with increased congestion levels.\n",
    "3. speed_std: Standard deviation of speed. High values indicate \"stop-and-go\" traffic, which is typical during high-congestion periods.\n",
    "4. lane_occupancy: The percentage of time a specific point on the road is occupied by a vehicle. Higher occupancy suggests saturated road capacity.\n",
    "5. queue_length: The length of the line of stationary or slow-moving vehicles. Longer queues indicate bottlenecks or incident-related backups.\n",
    "6. edge_density: A computer-vision metric representing the intensity of edges in an image; more edges typically signify the presence of more vehicles.\n",
    "7. optical_flow_mag: Measures the magnitude of motion between video frames. Low magnitude combined with high density indicates a \"gridlock\" state.\n",
    "8. shadow_fraction: The portion of the scene covered by shadows. While environmental, it can impact sensor accuracy and reflects the time of day.\n",
    "9. time_of_day_norm: Normalized time. Traffic patterns are highly cyclic (e.g., morning and evening rush hours).\n",
    "10. road_width_norm: Normalized width of the segment. Narrower roads (bottlenecks) have lower capacity and higher congestion risk.\n",

    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression emerged as the most robust candidate.\n",

    "- **Convergence**:\n",
    "  The learning curves for both F1-score and Recall show training and cross-validation scores converging tightly at approximately **2,500 samples**, indicating a **low-variance model** that generalizes well.\n",

    "- **Optimal Hyperparameters**:\n",
    "  Stable performance is observed for `C ≥ 10⁻¹`, making the model less sensitive to small tuning changes.\n",

    "#### B. The SVM Anomaly (High Recall vs. High Variance)\n",

    "While SVM achieved a peak Recall of **86% at `C = 0.01`**, it was not selected as the primary model due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extreme Sensitivity**:\n",
    "  A small change in the regularization parameter (`C`) caused Recall to drop sharply from **86% to 65%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information Gap**:\n",
    "  At the point of highest Recall, the variance (shown by the shaded region in the learning curve) was at its maximum, indicating **unpredictable performance** across different traffic data subsets.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Overfitting in Random Forest\n",

    "Random Forest achieved a competitive Recall of approximately **83%**, but the learning curve revealed a persistent gap between training and validation scores.\n",
